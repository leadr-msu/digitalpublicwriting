# Web Writing for the Public
## Writing for the Public
* Try to find a central question and organize your writing around it; let it drive your narrative
* Try to find new angles on ideas that were already of interest to people
	* Don't feel the need to find one tiny piece of history that nobody has ever discussed
	*  See what others are writing and what non-historian audiences may see or already know
	*  Steer clear of topics that are oversaturated
* Clear and concise prose without academic jargon - but *don't* feel like you need to "dumb it down"
* Use active verbs, vary sentence length, make subjects of your sentences characters
* Try to tell a story
	* Use a few characters to tell the story and demonstrate larger historical trends
	* Early on, create a mystery or emotional connection so they want to keep reading
	* Honor chronology whenever possible
	* Give people a stake in the story and make them want to continue
	* Provide forward movement, anticipation; give the feeling that you're going someplace
	* Don't leave out or bury the personal or interesting details
* Don't feel like you must demonstrate your deep knowledge of the historiography â€” just use historiography to highlight different interpretations and arguments 
* Reflect on writing you've liked and think about what makes it compelling
* Contextualize and add explanations for things people may not be familiar with
* Have non-historians/non-academics read a draft and share their thoughts with you
* Try putting your writing into [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to highlight confusing sentences, overly complicated words, passive voice, etc.

* Use well-structured headings and subheads to organize, signpost, and break up the text
* Try to use shorter sentences and paragraphs; don't indent paragraphs
* Use bullet points and numbered lists when possible
* Use photos and visual aids whenever possible
* Either use brackets ( [1] ) for footnotes or use brief parenthetical citations; should have a consistent style for an entire website or project
* Use white space to prevent readers from being overwhelmed

### Accessibility Tips
* Add ["alt text"](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) to photos with a concise description of the content of the photo
* Make sure [headings are nested and do not skip numbers](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/#contentstructure)
* Make sure that hyperlinked text provides clear context for the link
	* Ex: "Visit [LEADR's teaching resources](https://github.com/leadr-msu/Resources) for more info" rather than "LEADR teaching resources are [here](https://github.com/leadr-msu/Resources)".
* Don't make the text content space too wide or it can be difficult to read
* Use colors that contrast well so that low vision or colorblind readers do not have trouble
* Have transcripts or captions for all audio and video media
* The [WebAIM Introduction to Accessibility](https://webaim.org/intro/) has a great overview
